# Python Keylogger
**Disclaimer:** this project is for education purposes only! I'm not responsible for any unethical use of my code.

This script copies victims keystrokes and inputs it into a log file. From here it sends an email everyday with the log file attached.

**Note:** This script will be detected as a keylogger by anti virus so you'll need to diable that.

Prior to running the script you'll need to update...

-**s_email** to your senders email

-**s_pwd** to your senders password

-**r_email** to your recipients email

-**log_dir** to the directory where your log file will be stored (optional)
